	  <div class="projParaHeading">Overview</div>
	  <div class="projData">BROKE is mobile game that is the digitized version of our client, Dana Gold's, board game, "The Poverty Spiral". "The Poverty Spiral" is a simulation of the challenging decisions people living with the condition of poverty have to make when faced with few resources and many competing priorities (e.g. relationships, jobs, available cash. The original game is designed for 4-6 players and the goal is to reach and maintain Financial Stability before you run out of cards and choices. Each choice has a financial impact which makes the player experience the stress of how making the “right” decision isn’t always the best choice to get you out of poverty.</div>
	<div class="projData">We aim to design a transformational game by keeping the same impact of "The Poverty Spiral", but making it more accessible in the digital form. The players are assigned a role and then given the virtual phone of their character. They will be put into different situations where they interact and converse with NPCs to make tough decisions that impact their financial and social stability. The players will feel the frustration of living in poverty but also have an engaging, educational experience.</div>
